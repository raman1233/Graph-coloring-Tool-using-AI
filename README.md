## 🚀 How to Run the Graph Coloring Tool (Step-by-Step)

Follow these steps to run the Python-based Graph Coloring Tool on your system.

---

### 🧰 1. Prerequisites

- Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed.
- You can download Python from: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

To check if Python is installed, open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
python --version
```

or (on some systems):

```bash
python3 --version
```

---

### 📁 2. Download the Project File

Download or clone the project repository, or directly save the Python file `colourmapping2.py` to a folder of your choice.

---

### 💻 3. Open the Terminal / Command Prompt

Navigate to the folder where `colourmapping2.py` is saved. Example:

```bash
cd path/to/your/folder
```

---

### 📦 4. Install Required Libraries

This project uses built-in Python libraries, but make sure the following are available:

- `tkinter` – for the graphical user interface
- `matplotlib` – for graph drawing
- `networkx` – for graph structure and layout

To install the libraries, run the following commands:

```bash
pip install matplotlib networkx
```

> 💡 Note: `tkinter` is usually included with standard Python installations. If it’s missing, install it based on your OS:
> - On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
> - On Windows/Mac: reinstall Python and ensure `tcl/tk` is included.

---

### ▶️ 5. Run the Project

Once all libraries are installed, run the Python script using:

```bash
python colourmapping2.py
```

> Or use `python3` instead of `python` if required:

```bash
python3 colourmapping2.py
```

---

### ✅ 6. Use the Tool

- Enter number of **nodes**, **colors**, and choose **graph type**.
- Add edges if required.
- Press **Start** to view the colored graph.

Enjoy visualizing graph coloring with AI-powered CSP logic!
